## Background
Recently, a pharmaceutical company in China, Changchun Changsheng vaccine, is found and reported that they produced fake anti-rabies vaccines and DPT vaccines. As a programmer, the thing I can do is collecting the data from the CDC website of each province and see the distribution that the company (and other companies which are also involved in this scandal ) sold from 2016 to 2018. 
Important Notice: the data in this repo is NOT about the fake vaccines in this event. They are the history selling distribution from 2016 to 2018.
## Introduction
This article was originally published on my personal blog on weixin and v2ex. I did not think there were so many people pay attention to my article.

The follow-up updates will publish on github.

This repo is based on the point of view of technology. I will try to keep the objectivity。

## Few Things to Notice
- The data range is between 2016 and 2018
    - Each province is using one data based on the newest data.
    - I omit the additional data (Each year, after the government purchased the initial vaccines, there would be second, thrid and etc. purchases. )
- The data I am talking about
    - ***IS NOT ABOUT THIS SCANDAL***
- The data I am talking about is about
    - The distrbution in province that each companies involved in this scandal sold.
    - The range is relative wide (2016-2018);therefore, I did not consider the production batch.
## FAQ
- Is there any way to donate?
    -  No. I do not treat this as business or something.
    -  Much merged and incoming data comes from the pull requests. I just did some supporting things.
    -  And I can only do the supporting things after my work.
    -  therefore I can only reply at night.
- What's your purpose to do this?
    -  As a programmer, I naturally thought about other vaccines batches after one type of vaccine was reported fake.
    -  But when I tried to access their website, their website was shout down. I could only search manually.
    -  And then kept the key words of searching to prepare for the future.
- Did you use the robot to access the data?
    -  No! I searched and downloaded them manually, and I used script to process them.
    -  All the data comes from the government website(such as CDC).
- Why can't I see the production batches.
    - The distrbution in province that each companies involved in this scandal sold.
    - The range is relative wide (2016-2018);therefore, I did not consider the production batch.
