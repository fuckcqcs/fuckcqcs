## 前言
本文首发于个人的公众号和v2ex，事先也没想到会有这么多人关注。

由于本人文案水平不高，原先文中对此次疫苗事件背景的描述并不严谨的措辞。

v2ex账号因为没验证手机，也登陆不上了。所以后续更新基本会在github。

本文观点从技术讨论出发，尽量客观中立。

## 郑重声明 

- 数据年份是2016至2018年间的数据，
    - 每个省份一个数据，仅以能找到的最新的数据为主
    - 不考虑增补数据（每年第一批疫苗集中采购后，后续会根据政策再开第二批，第三批等等）
- 本文主要讨论的观点

    - **并不是本次新闻里的问题疫苗数据**
    - **并不是本次新闻里的问题疫苗数据**
    - **并不是本次新闻里的问题疫苗数据**
    
    本文讨论的观点是
    - 此次问题疫苗事件相关企业的各类疫苗在各省份的销售情况
    - 由于年度跨度长（2016-2018）所以批次范围不考虑数据批次

## 常见的Q&A

- 有没有打赏的渠道？
    -  这不是生意，不需要打赏（我怕控制不住我自己）
    -  后续很多其他的数据都是其他网友提供，我只是修修补补
    -  平时挺忙的，也就是下班才能进行修改
    -  所以一般晚上才进行回复

- 出于什么目的做了这个 
    - 程序员的思路，看到一个企业的疫苗不合格，自然会想到它其他的疫苗情况
    - 但是去它官网看的时候，官网也挂了，只能手动进行搜索
    - 然后把搜索的关键字记录了下来，方便以后重新搜索

- 用爬虫去爬的数据吗？
    - 不是！我是手工去搜索的，把数据另存为然后用脚本处理了一下
    - 所有的数据基本都是政府公示的信息种中获取     

- 为啥查不到批次
    - 此次问题疫苗事件相关企业的各类疫苗在各省份的销售情况
    - 由于年度跨度长（2016-2018）所以批次范围不考虑数据批次

- 长春长生不是cccs吗？cqcs是啥意思？
    - 我广东的，普通话不太准
## Background
Recently, a pharmaceutical company in China, Changchun Changsheng vaccine, is found and reported that they produced fake anti-rabies vaccines and DPT vaccines. As a programmer, the thing I can do is collecting the data from the CDC website of each province and see the distribution that the company (and other companies which are also involved in this scandal ) sold from 2016 to 2018. 
Important Notice: the data in this repo is NOT about the fake vaccines in this event. They are the history selling distribution from 2016 to 2018.
## Introduction
This article was originally published on my personal blog on weixin and v2ex. I did not think there were so many people pay attention to my article.

The follow-up updates will publish on github.

This repo is based on the point of view of technology. I will try to keep the objectivity。

## Few Things to Notice
- The data range is between 2016 and 2018
    - Each province is using one data based on the newest data.
    - I omit the additional data (Each year, after the government purchased the initial vaccines, there would be second, thrid and etc. purchases. )
- The data I am talking about
    - ***IS NOT ABOUT THIS SCANDAL***
- The data I am talking about is about
    - The distrbution in province that each companies involved in this scandal sold.
    - The range is relative wide (2016-2018);therefore, I did not consider the production batch.
## FAQ
- Is there any way to donate?
    -  No. I do not treat this as business or something.
    -  Much merged and incoming data comes from the pull requests. I just did some supporting things.
    -  And I can only do the supporting things after my work.
    -  therefore I can only reply at night.
- What's your purpose to do this?
    -  As a programmer, I naturally thought about other vaccines batches after one type of vaccine was reported fake.
    -  But when I tried to access their website, their website was shout down. I could only search manually.
    -  And then kept the key words of searching to prepare for the future.
- Did you use the robot to access the data?
    -  No! I searched and downloaded them manually, and I used script to process them.
    -  All the data comes from the government website(such as CDC).
- Why can't I see the production batches.
    - The distrbution in province that each companies involved in this scandal sold.
    - The range is relative wide (2016-2018);therefore, I did not consider the production batch.
